        <h1>Who is Alicia?</h1>
        <p>In 2012, I took a leap of faith when I moved from my hometown in southern California to start anew in Washington, D.C. Apparently I was going to be the next Olivia Pope, “<a href="https://youtu.be/Arpp-ZdrkXQ?t=1m56s">a gladiator in a suit</a>!" Since then, I’ve helped all sorts of organizations (a think-tank, bank and foundation) keep customers informed, feeling good and wanting to come back for more business.</p>

    <h1>Top-notch Customer Service</h1>
    <p>Though I’ve worked with a unique set of organizations, the ability to keep customers satisfied has always been my primary focus. I’ve written materials to keep campaign members informed, organized events to engage donors and provided administrative support on trust and investment accounts of high net worth clients. Take a look at <a href="images/resume.pdf">my resume</a> for a more detailed look into my work experience.</p>

    <h1>Educational Background</h1>
    <p>I got my bachelor’s in anthropology and political science. Over the last year, web development and computer programming have been two of my favorite things to learn about. You can view the progress I’m making online at <a href="https://github.com/Aliciawyse">GitHub</a>.</p>
