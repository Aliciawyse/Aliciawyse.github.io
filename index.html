        <h1>About Alicia</h1>
        <p>In 2012, I took a leap of faith when I moved from my hometown in southern California to start anew in Washington, D.C. Apparently I was going to be the next "<a href="https://youtu.be/Arpp-ZdrkXQ">gladiator in a suit</a>!" Instead of fixing people's scandalous lives like Olivia Pope, I've helped bootstrapped nonprofits to big corporations improve their customer service so that they can keep their clients happy and informed.</p>

    <h1>Top-notch Customer Service</h1>
    <p>I'm sure you know what bad customer service feels like, but do you know <a href="https://www.desk.com/success-center/bad-customer-service"> how much it costs</a>? My primary focus is to help companies save money through awesome customer service. Take a look at <a href="images/resume.pdf">my resume</a> to see what I mean.</p>

    <h1>Looking Ahead</h1>
    <p>I got my bachelor’s in anthropology and political science, but over the last year web development and computer programming have been two of my favorite things to learn about. Looking ahead, I want to help companies create the technology used to deliver awesome customer service. You can view the progress I’m making online at <a href="https://github.com/Aliciawyse">GitHub</a>.</p>
